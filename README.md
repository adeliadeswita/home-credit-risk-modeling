# CREDIT RISK PREDICTION HOME CREDIT
  
Home Credit faces challenges in accurately predicting credit scores, leading to the rejection of creditworthy customers and the approval of high-risk borrowers, resulting in lost revenue and increased default rates. Additionally, the current loan structuring (principal, maturity, and repayment schedule) is not fully optimized to enhance repayment success, and the lack of explainability in credit decisions reduces customer trust and regulatory compliance.

**Goal** : 
Enhance the accuracy of credit scoring predictions to ensure that creditworthy customers are not rejected and to optimize loan structuring (principal, maturity, and repayment calendar) to increase the likelihood of successful loan repayment.

**Objectives** :
* Build and evaluate Machine Learning models to predict the likelihood of customers repaying their loans.
* Identify the most significant features affecting customersâ€™ repayment capabilities.
* Recommend the best approach to determining principal, maturity, and repayment schedules to motivate successful loan repayment.

**Metrics** :     
* Accuracy Score
* Precision & Recall
* F1 Score

**Core Business Questions to Address**
* How can we improve the accuracy of our credit scoring model to reduce false rejections?
* What loan structuring strategies (principal, maturity, repayment calendar) can be optimized to increase repayment rates?
* Which features or customer behaviors are the strongest indicators of loan repayment?
